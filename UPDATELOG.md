## v0.5.1

### Important Notes

- If you encounter any issues, please go to Settings â†’ Configuration Directory, back up your data, then delete all files and try again!
- After three months of intensive development and rigorous testing, the stable version v0.5.1 is finally released: significant improvements in performance and stability. Clash Verge Rev now boasts robustness comparable to cfw, while being more powerful and user-friendly!
- Due to changes in the service installation logic, the first installation on Mac/Linux requires entering the system password to uninstall and install the service. After that, you can seamlessly use TUN (virtual network card) mode.
- Due to a bug in Tauri 2.0, the webview process remains after closing the window. The advantage is that reopening the panel is faster, but the downside is a slight increase in memory usage.

### v0.5.1 Compared to 0.5.0

- **Added support for ARM64 architecture**:
  - Windows ARM64
  - Linux ARM64
- Fixed errors related to DNS, bypass, dual Monaco editors for PAC, and logic after updates.
- Enhanced overall styling for a more refined user interface.
- Corrected Windows CMD content errors that caused invalid proxy commands.

### v0.5.1 Compared to 0.4.6

- Improved robustness on macOS/Linux/Windows, fixing various service startup issues.
- Redesigned the interface, cleared many erroneous code logics from before, and improved user experience.

### Major Changes

- Major framework upgrade: migrated to Tauri 2.0 (significant improvements and performance enhancements).
- Submit issues to report bugs; no longer accepting bug reports for version 0.4.x.
- Strongly recommend completely uninstalling the old version 0.4.x before installing this version.

### Performance

- Optimized and refactored the kernel startup management logic.
- Optimized the system DNS settings logic.
- Bypass settings logic.
- PAC settings logic.

### Known Issues

- Window size on Windows does not remember its size (waiting for upstream fix).
- On Linux, the title bar buttons require enlarging the window before you can click to close or minimize.

I have finally completed the refactoring of the old version and migrated to the new framework. Although some features are still missing, this version should offer the best user experience. Come and try it out!
